# Lock and Unlock with Voice
This project demonstrates how the speech recognition API can be used to retrieve a spoken word from a user and perform an action (e.g. locking/unlocking a padlock) if that word is valid.

The speech recognition API is currently only [supported by Chrome](https://caniuse.com/#search=speech%20recognition).
